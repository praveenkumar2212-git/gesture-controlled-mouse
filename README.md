# virtual_mouse
A real-time, touchless virtual mouse that uses hand gestures to move the cursor, click, and capture screenshots. Built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, it tracks 21 hand landmarks and analyzes finger angles and distances to map gestures into smooth, intuitive mouse actions for a futuristic interaction experience.
